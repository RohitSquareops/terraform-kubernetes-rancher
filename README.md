This module provides a Terraform configuration for deploying Rancher on a Kubernetes cluster. Rancher is a powerful open-source platform for managing Kubernetes clusters and containerized applications. With this module, you can easily deploy Rancher on your Kubernetes cluster with just a few lines of code.
Features

  1.  Quick and easy deployment of Rancher on Kubernetes
  2.  Configuration options for customizing Rancher installation
  3.  Automatic generation of Kubernetes resources
  4.  Support for deploying Rancher on a single node or multiple nodes

## Supported Versions Table:

| Rancher Helm Chart Version       |     K8s supported version   |  
 | :-----:                       |         :---         |
 | **2.7.0**          |    **1.23,1.24**       |
 | **2.7.2**          |    **1.23,1.24,1.25**      |

## Important Notes:
This module is compatible with EKS version 1.23, which is great news for users deploying the module on an EKS cluster running that version. Review the module's documentation, meet specific configuration requirements, and test thoroughly after deployment to ensure everything works as expected.
## Usage Example

```hcl
module "rancher" {
  source         = "squareops/rancher/kubernetes"
  rancher_config = {
    email    = "email@email.com"
    hostname = ""
    values_yaml = ""
  }
}
